      ![](images/m4-img25.png)

1.	Next, for **Choose a workflow** click on **set up a workflow yourself**.  

      ![](images/m4-img26.png)

1. Enter the name for your workflow file as **msdevopssec.yml (1)**. Then copy and paste the following sample action workflow into the **Edit new file (2)** tab. 

      ```
      name: MSDO IaC Scan
         
      on:
           # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
           push:
             branches: [ main ]
         
           pull_request:
             branches: [ main ]
         
           workflow_dispatch:
         
      jobs:
           security:
             runs-on: ubuntu-latest
             continue-on-error: false
             strategy:
               fail-fast: true
         
             steps:
