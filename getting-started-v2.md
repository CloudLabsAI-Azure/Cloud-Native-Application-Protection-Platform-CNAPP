# Defender Cloud Security Posture Management

### Overall Estimated Duration: 1 Hour

## Overview

A Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) is a unified security solution tailored to protect cloud-native applications throughout their entire lifecycle. It integrates various security tools and processes to enhance visibility, ensure compliance, and provide robust threat protection across different environments, including infrastructure, application, and runtime. Key features encompass infrastructure security for identifying vulnerabilities, application security through comprehensive code scanning, runtime protection for real-time threat detection, and compliance management that automates adherence to regulations and industry standards.

For a retail company like Contoso, transitioning to a cloud-native architecture for its e-commerce platform involves leveraging a CNAPP to enhance security measures. The platform monitors cloud infrastructure for misconfigurations, scans code for vulnerabilities, and detects unusual behaviors during runtime to protect against attacks.

## Objective

The objective of the CNAPP lab is to equip participants with the skills to secure and manage cloud-native applications through hands-on experience in visibility, risk assessment, and threat detection.

- **Defender Cloud Security Posture Management:** To enhance cloud security by assessing and improving the security posture of cloud environments through continuous monitoring and compliance checks.

## Prerequisites

Participants should have:

- **Basic Cloud Knowledge:** Familiarity with cloud computing concepts and Azure services.

- **Security Fundamentals:** A grasp of basic cybersecurity principles and practices.

## Architechture

The architecture of the lab integrates various Azure services and components to create a secure, scalable environment for cloud-native applications. At the core, Azure Defender for Cloud monitors and manages the security posture of both Azure and hybrid environments, ensuring compliance and risk mitigation.
